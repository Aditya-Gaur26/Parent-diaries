2. If a milestone is found, return it in this exact format: "Child: [child's name or UNKNOWN], Milestone: [concise milestone description]"
3. If no milestone is found, just return "None"

Only identify a child if you're confident which child the milestone refers to based on names mentioned in the journal or context. Otherwise, use UNKNOWN.`
